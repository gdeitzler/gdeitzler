- 👋 Hi, I’m Grace!
- 👀 I'm a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University studying the microbiome, probiotics, and intestinal disease.
- 👩‍💻 I've been on my R learning journey for about 8 years, and primarily use it for microbiome analysis, other -omics, and multivariate statistical analysis. I'm also learning python!
- ✨ I'm a huge ggplot2 & data viz in R enthusiast! I'm also in the process of creating my own ggplot2-compatible color palette packages.
- 🌱 You can find project code from my PhD in the MaudeDavidLab organization: https://github.com/MaudeDavidLab
